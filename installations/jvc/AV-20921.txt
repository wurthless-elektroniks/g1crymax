HR Diemen results:
HR DIEMEN PINOUT DOES NOT MATCH ACTUAL PINOUT

CRT is a JVC model A51KRE89X
Tubular database has no entry
Assuming -50VDC is the safe maximum G1 voltage

Pinout of transformer, measured with diode with cathode pointing towards positive and smoothing capacitor:

1 ABL (n/a)
2 NC (measured approx -8 VDC) 
3 HB (measured approx -28 VDC)

Used HB voltage without voltage divider

Measured -25VDC at G1 pin while set in operation
