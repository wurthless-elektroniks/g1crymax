CRT Pin 5 is G1
G1 is grounded
Nearby G2 pin is tied to same ground trace via a class-Y cap or somesuch

Jungle chip for future reference is a IX3253CE
Blanking = pin 14
Red in = pin 15

Pin 11 is probably B+
Pin 12 is switched by HOT
Pins 2 and 4 appear to be ground

With capacitor/diode pointing positive end towards ground:
Pin 1 - approx. -31VDC
Pin 3 - approx. -3VDC

Pin 1 will work fine
