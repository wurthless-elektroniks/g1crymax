G1 Crymax installlog for RCA E13320, chassis rev. TX808H
Probably one of the nicest 13" TVs you can get

Tube is a 37GDA86X
Neck pin 6 is G1
Assuming -50VDC safe limit

Anode of diode DL45 (next to flyback) measured -200VDC

****      CRT SOCKET SHORTS PIN 6 TO GROUND       ****
**** ATTEMPT THE FOLLOWING HACK AT YOUR OWN RISK  *****

Lifted socket pin 2 from ground (probably defeating overvoltage protection on focus wire in the process)
Pin 6 now isolated from ground

Using 330k/100k voltage divider with extra diode to enforce polarity on the voltage divider

Measured approx. -46VDC at G1 pin

Job done
