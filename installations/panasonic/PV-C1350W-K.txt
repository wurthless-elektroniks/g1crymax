Google turned up a service manual

Service manual says:
- Press STOP/PLAY/VOL DOWN buttons for 5 seconds to enter service mode
- Use remote control to make adjustments
I do not have the remote control so I cannot recalibrate colors.

TP551 / TP552 are said to provide approximately -20VDC; signals originate from flyback pin 1 (ABL)
TP551 / TP552 actually measured approx -5 VDC; insufficient for our purposes

Pin 8 of flyback goes to D558; tapping this yielded approx -120VDC
Formed voltage divider with R1 = 47k and R2 = 22k

Measured approx. -50VDC at G1 pin

Since this is a 13" set and tests were done over RF, differences were negligible; however, it's still a success
